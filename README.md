# Backend for todo-webapp

See [frontend repository](https://github.com/Smail/todo-webapp-frontend).

## Install

Node version: 16

``yarn install``

* Unix: Execute `setup.sh`.
* Windows: Execute `bash setup.sh` if bash is available. Executing it from WSL doesn't work because WSL sets the wrong permissions and these cannot be changed in WSL.

## Run

``yarn serve``
